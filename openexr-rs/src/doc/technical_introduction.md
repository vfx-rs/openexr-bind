# Overview

OpenEXR is an open-source high-dynamic-range floating-point image file
format for high-quality image processing and storage. This document
presents a brief overview of OpenEXR and explains concepts that are
specific to this format.

# Features of OpenEXR

Starting in 1999, Industrial Light & Magic developed OpenEXR, a
high-dynamic-range image file format for use in digital visual effects
production. In early 2003, after using and refining the file format for
a few years, ILM released OpenEXR as an open-source C++ library. In 2013
Weta Digital and ILM jointly released OpenEXR version 2.0, which added
support for deep images and multi-part files.

A unique combination of features makes OpenEXR a good fit for
high-quality image processing and storage applications:

## High dynamic range

Pixel data are stored as 16-bit or 32-bit floating-point numbers. With
16 bits, the dynamic range that can be represented is significantly
higher than the range of most image capture devices: $10^9$
or 30 f-stops without loss of precision, and an additional 10 f-stops at
the low end with some loss of precision. Most 8-bit file formats have
around 7 to 10 f-stops.

## Good color resolution

With 16-bit floating-point numbers, color resolution is 1024 steps per
f-stop, as opposed to somewhere around 20 to 70 steps per f-stop for
most 8-bit file formats. Even after significant processing, for example,
extensive color correction, images tend to show no noticeable color
banding.

## Lossless and lossy data compression

OpenEXR employs data compression to reduce the size of image files. Most
of the available compression methods are lossless; repeatedly
compressing and uncompressing an image does not change the pixel data.
With the lossless compression methods, photographic images with
significant amounts of film grain tend to shrink to somewhere between 35
and 55 percent of their uncompressed size. OpenEXR also supports lossy
compression, which tends to shrink image files more than lossless
compression, but doesn\'t preserve the image data exactly.

## Arbitrary image channels

OpenEXR images can contain an arbitrary number and combination of image
channels, for example red, green, blue, and alpha; luminance and
sub-sampled chroma channels; depth, surface normal directions, or motion
vectors.

## Scan-line and tiled images, multi-resolution images

Pixels in an OpenEXR image can be stored either as scan lines or as
tiles. Tiled image files allow random access to rectangular sub-regions
of an image. Multiple versions of a tiled image, each with a different
resolution, can be stored in a single multi-resolution OpenEXR file.

Multi-resolution images, often called "mipmaps" or "ripmaps," are
commonly used as texture maps in 3D rendering programs to accelerate
filtering during texture lookup, or for operations like stereo image
matching. Tiled multi-resolution images are also useful for implementing
fast zooming and panning in programs that interactively display very
large images.

## Multiple views

OpenEXR files can store multi-view images that show the same scene from
multiple different points of view. A common application is 3D stereo
imagery, where a left-eye and a right-eye view of a scene are stored in
a single file.

## Deep images

OpenEXR can store deep images, where each pixel contains an arbitrarily
long list of values or samples in each channel. In computer graphics,
applications for deep images include, for example, easy and accurate
compositing of objects that occlude one another in ways that make
compositing by stacking flat images difficult, or nearly artifact-free
motion blur and depth-of-field blur image processing operations.

## Multi-part files

An OpenEXR file may contain multiple independent images or "parts" with
different sets of image channels, resolutions and data compression
methods.

Multi-part files are useful when an image contains a large number of
channels, but file readers are expected read only a subset of those
channels at a time. Placing each such subset in a separate part speeds
up file reading, since channels that are not needed by the reader are
never accessed.

## Ability to store additional data

Often it is necessary to annotate images with additional data; for
example, color timing information, process tracking data, or camera
position and view direction. OpenEXR allows storing of an arbitrary
number of extra attributes, of arbitrary type, in an image file.
Software that reads OpenEXR files ignores attributes it does not
understand.

## Easy-to-use interfaces

Two levels of access to image files are provided: a fully general interface for
writing and reading files with arbitrary sets of image channels, and a
specialized interface for the most common case (red, green, blue, and
alpha channels, or some subset of those). 

Many application programs expect image files to be scan line-based and
flat. With the OpenEXR programming interface, applications that cannot
handle tiled or deep images can treat all OpenEXR files as if they were
scan-line based and flat; the interface automatically converts tiles to
scan lines and flattens deep pixels.

## Fast multi-threaded file reading and writing

The openexr crate supports multi-threaded reading or writing of an
OpenEXR image file: while one thread performs low-level file input or
output, multiple other threads simultaneously encode or decode
individual pieces of the file.

## Portability

The OpenEXR file format is hardware and operating system independent.

# Definitions and Terminology

## Flat and Deep Images

A ***flat image*** has at most one stored value or ***sample*** per
pixel per channel.

\[Example: the most common case is a red-green-blue or RGB image, which
contains three channels, and every pixel has exactly one red, one green
and one blue sample. Some channels in a flat image may be sub-sampled,
as is the case with luminance-chroma images, where the luminance channel
has a sample at every pixel, but the chroma channels have samples only
at every second pixel of every second scan line.\]

A ***deep image*** can store an unlimited number of samples per pixel,
and each of those samples is associated with a depth, or distance from
the viewer. All channels in a single pixel have the same number of
samples, but the number of samples varies from pixel to pixel, and any
non-negative number of samples, including zero, is allowed.

## Parts, Images, Single-Part and Multi-Part Files

In an OpenEXR file a ***part*** is a separate image, consisting of a
header and an array of pixels. A ***single-part file*** contains exactly
one part. A ***multi-part file*** contains two or more parts, each with
its own header and corresponding pixels.

An ***image*** is the set of all channels in a single part. The images
in a multi-part file are largely independent of each other; a file may
contain a mixture of flat and deep images.

## Headers and Attributes

Each part in an OpenEXR file has a ***header***. The header is a list of
***attributes*** that describe the pixels in the part. An attribute is a
name-value pair, where the name is a text string and the value is an
item of an arbitrary data type. For example, each header includes an
attribute whose name is "pixelAspectRatio," and whose value is a
floating-point number that tells application software how to display the
corresponding image at the correct aspect ratio.

## Pixel space, Display Window and Data Window

***Pixel space*** is a 2D coordinate system with x increasing from left
to right and y increasing from top to bottom. Pixels are data samples
(for flat images), or lists of data samples (for deep images), that are
located at integer coordinate locations in pixel space.

The boundaries of an OpenEXR image are given as an axis-parallel
rectangular region in pixel space, the ***display window***. The display
window is defined by the positions of the pixels in the upper left and
lower right corners.

An OpenEXR image may not have pixel data for all the pixels in the
display window, or it may have pixel data beyond the boundaries of the
display window. The region for which pixel data are available is defined
by a second axis-parallel rectangle in pixel space, the ***data
window***.

In this document the notation $(x_{min}, y_{min}) - (x_{max}, y_{max})$
is used to describe a window whose upper left and lower right corners
are at $(x_{min}, y_{min})$ and $(x_{max}, y_{max})$, respectively.

### Example

Assume that we are producing a movie with a resolution of 1920 by 1080
pixels. The display window for all frames of the movie is (0, 0) -
(1919, 1079). For most images, in particular finished frames that will
be delivered to the customer, the data window is the same as the display
window, but for some images that are used in producing the finished
frames, the data window differs from the display window.

For a background plate that will be heavily post-processed, extra pixels
beyond the edge of the display frame are recorded, and the data window
is set to (-100, -100) - (2019, 1179). The extra pixels are not normally
displayed, but their existence allows operations such as large-kernel
blurs or simulated camera shake to avoid edge artifacts. (In order to
compute the color of a pixel near the edge of the display window, a blur
kernel must consider pixels outside the display window.)

![Windows 1](ti_windows)

While tweaking a computer-generated image element, an artist repeatedly
renders the same frame. To save time, the artist renders only a small
region of interest close to the center of the image. The data window of
the image is set to (1000, 400) - (1400, 800). When the image is
displayed, the display program fills the area outside of the data window
with some default color.

![Windows 2](ti_windows2)

## Image Channels and Sampling Rates

Every OpenEXR image contains one or more image ***channels***. Each
channel has a ***name***, a ***data type***, and x and y ***sampling
rates***.

The channel\'s name is a text string, for example "R", "Z" or
"yVelocity". The name tells programs that read the image file how to
interpret the data in the channel.

For a few channel names, for example, "R", "G", "B" and "A", the
interpretation of the data is predefined by code in the IlmImf library,
but the interpretation of channels with other names is left to
application software.

The data type of a channel determines the data type of the corresponding
values in the pixels. OpenEXR supports three channel data types

| Type name | Pixel data type |
| --- | --- |
| HALF | 16-bit binary floating-point numbers according to IEEE standard 754-2008. Used for regular image data. |
| FLOAT |32-bit binary floating-point numbers according to IEEE standard 754-2008. Used where the range or precision of 16-bit numbers is not sufficient, for example, depth channels. |
| UINT | 32-bit unsigned integers. Used for discrete per-pixel data such as object identifiers. |

The x and y sampling rates of a channel, $s_x$ and $s_y$,
determine for which of the pixels within the data window data are stored
in the file. Data for a pixel at pixel space coordinates $(x, y)$ are stored only if
$x \medspace mod \medspace s_x = 0$ and $y \medspace mod \medspace s_y = 0$. (The notation $x \medspace mod \medspace y$
refers to the remainder of the integer
division $x/y$.

### Examples

For RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) images, $s_x$ and $s_y$
are 1 for all channels, and each channel contains data for every pixel.
For other types of images, some channels may be sub-sampled. In images
with one luminance channel and two chroma channels, $s_x$
and $s_y$ would be 1 for the luminance channel, but 2 for the chroma channels,
indicating that chroma data are present only at every second pixel of
every second scan line.


## Restrictions on Sampling Rates

Channels with an x or y sampling rate other than 1 are allowed only in
flat, scan-line based images. If an image is deep or tiled, then the x
and y sampling rates for all of its channels must be 1.

## Projection, Camera Coordinate System and Screen Window

Many images are generated by a perspective projection. We assume that a
camera is located at the origin,
$O$, of a 3D camera coordinate system. The camera looks along the positive
$z$ axis. The
positive $x$ and $y$ axes correspond to the camera\'s "left" and "up" directions. The 3D scene is projected
onto the $z=1$
plane. The image recorded by the camera is bounded by a rectangle, the
***screen window***. In pixel space, the screen window corresponds to
the image\'s display window. In the file, the size and position of the
screen window are specified by the
$x$ and $y$ coordinates of the window\'s center,
$C$, and by the window\'s width, $W$.
The height of the screen can be derived from
$C$, $W$, the display window and
the pixel aspect ratio (see below).

![Image 3](ti_image3)

## Pixel Aspect Ratio

The ***pixel aspect ratio*** of an image is the ratio $\frac{d_x}{d_y}$,
where $d_x$ is the distance between pixel space locations $(x, y)$ and $(x+1, y)$, and $d_y$
is the distance between pixel space locations $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1) on the
display when the image is displayed at the correct aspect ratio; that
is, when the width divided by the height of the displayed image is as
intended.

### Examples

An image whose display window is (0, 0) -- (1919, 1079) is
meant to be displayed with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The image has a pixel
aspect ratio of 1.0. If an image with the same data window is meant to
be displayed with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, then its pixel aspect ratio
is 1.322.

## Scan Lines

In scan-line based images, pixels are stored in horizontal rows, or ***scan lines***. An image whose data window is 
$(x_{min}, y_{min}) - (x_{max}, y_{max})$ contains $x_{max} - x_{min} + 1$ scan lines. Each scan line contains $y_{max} - y_{min} + 1$ pixels.

Scan-line based images cannot be multi-resolution images.

## Tiles

In tiled images, the data window is subdivided into an array of smaller
rectangles, called ***tiles***. Each tile contains $p_x$ by $p_y$ pixels. An image whose data window is 
$(x_{min}, y_{min}) - (x_{max}, y_{max})$
contains

\$\$
\\left\\lceil \\frac{w}{p\_{x}}
\\right\\rceil
\$\$

by

\$\$\\left\\lceil \\frac{w}{p\_{x}}
\\right\\rceil\$\$

tiles, where $w$ and
$h$ are the width and height
of the data window,

\$\$\\begin{matrix} w = x\_{\\max} - x\_{\\min} -   1 \\\\ h = y\_{\\max} - y\_{\\min} + 1 \\\\ \\end{matrix},\$\$

and the notation $\lceil x \rceil$ refers to the ceiling of $x$, that
is, the lowest integer not less than $x$.

The upper left corner of the upper left tile is aligned with the upper
left corner of the data window at $(x_{min}, y_{min})$.  The rightmost column and the bottom row of tiles may extend outside the
data window. If a tile contains pixels that are outside the data window,
then those extra pixels are discarded when the tile is stored in the
file.

![image4](ti_image4)

## Levels and Level Modes

A single tiled part of OpenEXR file may contain multiple versions of the
same image, each with a different resolution. Each version is called a
***level***. The number of levels in a part and their resolutions depend
on the part\'s ***level mode***. OpenEXR supports three level modes:

[`LevelMode::OneLevel`]: crate::LevelMode::OneLevel
[`LevelMode::MipmapLevels`]: crate::LevelMode::MipmapLevels
[`LevelMode::RipmapLevels`]: crate::LevelMode::RipmapLevels

| Mode Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`LevelMode::OneLevel`] | The part contains only a single full-resolution level. A tiled ONE_LEVEL image is equivalent to a scan line based image; the only difference is that pixels are accessed by tile rather than by scan line.|
| [`LevelMode::MipmapLevels`] |<p>The part contains multiple versions of the image. Each successive level is half the resolution of the previous level in both dimensions. The lowest-resolution level contains only a single pixel.</p> <p>e.g. if the first level, with full resolution, contains 16×8 pixels, then the file contains four more levels with 8×4, 4×2, 2×1, and 1×1 pixels respectively.]</p> |
| [`LevelMode::RipmapLevels`] |<p>Like [`LevelMode::MipmapLevels`], but with more levels. The levels include all combinations of reducing the resolution of the first level by powers of two independently in both dimensions.</p> <p>e.g. if the full-resolution level contains 4×4 pixels, then the part contains eight more levels, with the following resolutions:</p> <table style="width:50%;border:none"> <colgroup> <col style="width: 33%" /> <col style="width: 33%" /> <col style="width: 33%" /> </colgroup> <tr> <td></td> <td>2×4</td> <td>1×4</td> </tr> <tbody> <tr class="odd odd"> <td>4×2</td> <td>2×2</td> <td>1×2</td> </tr> <tr class="even even"> <td>4×1</td> <td>2×1</td> <td>1×1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> |

## Level Numbers, Level Sizes and Rounding Mode

Levels are identified by ***level numbers***. A level number is a pair
of integers, $(l_x, l_y)$.
Level $(0, 0)$ is the highest-resolution level, with $w$ by $h$ pixels. Level $(l_x, l_y)$
contains

\$\$\\text{rf}\\left( \\frac{w}{2\^{l\_{x}}} \\right)\$\$

by

\$\$\\text{rf}\\left( \\frac{h}{2\^{l\_{y}}} \\right)\$\$

pixels, where $rf(x)$ is a rounding function that depends on the ***level size rounding mode***:

[`LevelRoundingMode::RoundDown`]: crate::LevelRoundingMode::RoundDown
[`LevelRoundingMode::RoundUp`]: crate::LevelRoundingMode::RoundUp

| Rounding mode | Rounding function |
| --- | --- |
| [`LevelRoundingMode::RoundDown`] | $\lfloor x \rfloor$ (floor of $x$, highest integer not greater than $x$) | 
| [`LevelRoundingMode::RoundUp`] | $\lceil x \rceil$ (ceiling of $x$, lowest integer not less than $x$) |

Parts whose level mode is [`LevelMode::MipmapLevels`] contain only levels where $l_x = l_y$.
Parts whose level mode is [`LevelMode::OneLevel`] contain only level $(0, 0)$.

### Examples

The levels in a [`LevelMode::RipmapLevels`] part whose highest-resolution level
contains 4 by 4 pixels have the following level numbers:

|        |   |          |          |          |
|--------|---|----------|----------|----------|
|        |   |          |  width   |          |
|        |   |    4     |     2    |     1    |
|        | 4 | $(0, 0)$ | $(1, 0)$ | $(2, 0)$ |
| height | 2 | $(0, 1)$ | $(1, 1)$ | $(2, 1)$ |
|        | 1 | $(0, 2)$ | $(1, 2)$ | $(2, 2)$ |


In an equivalent [`LevelMode::MipmapLevels`] part, only levels $(0, 0)$,
$(1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$ are present.

In a [`LevelMode::MipmapLevels`] part with a highest-resolution level of 15 by 17
pixels, the resolutions of the remaining levels depend on the level size
rounding mode:

| Rounding mode | Level resolutions |
|---|---|
| [`LevelRoundingMode::RoundDown`] | 15×17, 7×8, 3×4, 1×2, 1×1 |
| [`LevelRoundingMode::RoundUp`] | 15×17, 8×9, 4×5, 2×3, 1×2, 1×1 |



## Tile Coordinates

In a part with multiple levels, tiles have the same size, regardless of
their level. Lower-resolution levels contain fewer, rather than smaller,
tiles. Within a level, a tile is identified by a pair of integer ***tile
coordinates***, which specify the tile\'s column and row. The upper left
tile has coordinates
$(0, 0)$, and the
coordinates increase from left to right and top to bottom respectively.
In order to identify a tile uniquely within a multi-resolution part,
both the tile coordinates and the level number are needed.

## Views

A ***view*** is a set of image channels, identified by a naming
convention and a header attribute. This is commonly used to store stereo
files, with one view for each eye. For flat images, views can be stored
in separate files, separate parts of a single file, or together in a
single part. For deep images, views can be stored in separate files or
separate parts of a single file, but they cannot be stored together in a
single part.

For details, see [Multi-View OpenEXR Files](crate::doc::multi_view_open_exr).

# OpenEXR File Structure

An OpenEXR file consists of one or more parts. Each part has a header
and a corresponding array of pixels.

## Header

The header is a list of attributes that describe the image in a part. To
ensure that OpenEXR files written by one program can be read by other
programs, certain required attributes must be present in every header:

| Attribute Name | Description |
|---|---|
|displayWindow, dataWindow              | The display and data window of the image.
|pixelAspectRatio                       | The pixel aspect ratio of the image.
|channels                               | Description of the image channels stored in the image.
|compression                            | Specifies the compression method applied to the pixel data of all channels in the image.
|lineOrder                              | Specifies in what order the scan lines in the file are stored in the file (increasing Y, decreasing Y, or, for tiled images, also random Y).
|screenWindowWidth, screenWindowCenter  | Describe the perspective projection that produced the image (see page 8). Programs that deal with images as purely two-dimensional objects may not be able to generate a description of a perspective projection. Those programs should set screenWindowWidth to 1, and screenWindowCenter to  (0, 0).
|tiles                                  | This attribute is required only for tiled flat or tiled deep images. It specifies the size of the tiles, the level mode and the level size rounding mode of the image.

In multi-part and deep files, additional attributes must be present the
header of each part:

<table style="width:99%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 24%" />
<col style="width: 75%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header header">
<th>Attribute Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd odd">
<td>name</td>
<td>The name of the part. Part names must be unique, that is, no two parts in a file may share the same name.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even even">
<td>type</td>
<td><p>The type of image stored in the part. Four types are possible:</p>
<table style="width:99%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 30%" />
<col style="width: 69%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>`ImageType::Scanline`: "scanlineimage" </td>
<td>Flat, scan-line based.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd odd">
<td>`ImageType::Tiled`: "tiledimage"</td>
<td>Flat, tiled.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even even">
<td>`ImageType::DeepScanline`: "deepscanline"</td>
<td>Deep, scan-line based.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd odd">
<td>`ImageType::DeepTiled`: "deeptile"</td>
<td>Deep, tiled.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd odd">
<td>maxSamplesPerPixel</td>
<td>This attribute is automatically added to deep files, and its value is set by the IlmImf library when the file is written. The attribute indicates the maximum number of samples in any single pixel within the image. Application code may use this number to make memory allocation more efficient for image processing: if the maximum number of samples is small, then the application may want to allocate that many samples for every pixel, thus making the in-memory layout of an image more regular by eliminating many pointers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In addition to the required attributes, application software may place any
number of additional attributes in the headers. Often it is necessary to
annotate an image with additional data, for example, color timing
information, process tracking data, or camera position and view
direction. Those data can be packaged as extra attributes in the header
of the image.

## Constraints on Attribute Values

The parts in a multi-part OpenEXR file are not entirely independent. The
values of the displayWindow and pixelAspectRatio attributes must be the
same for all parts of a file. For example, it is not possible to have
one part with a pixel aspect ratio of 1.0 and another part with a pixel
aspect ratio of 1.5.

In addition, if the headers include timeCode and chromaticities
attributes, then the values of those attributes must also be the same
for all parts of a file. (The timeCode and chromaticities attributes are
defined in the openexr crate. The purpose of the chromaticities
attribute is described under ["RGB Color"](#rgb-color).

## Scan Lines

[`LineOrder::IncreasingY`]: crate::LineOrder::IncreasingY
[`LineOrder::DecreasingY`]: crate::LineOrder::DecreasingY
[`LineOrder::RandomY`]: crate::LineOrder::RandomY

When a scan-line based image is written, application code must set the
lineOrder attribute in the header to [`LineOrder::IncreasingY`] order (top scan line
first) or [`LineOrder::DecreasingY`] order (bottom scan line first). Application code
must then write the scan lines in the specified order. When a scan-line
based file is read, random access to the scan lines is possible; the
scan lines can be read in any order. However, reading the scan lines in
the same order as they were written causes the file to be read
sequentially, without "seek" operations, and as fast as possible.

Note that the lineOrder attribute does not affect the orientation of the
pixel space coordinate system. Pixel space y coordinates always increase
from top to bottom. The lineOrder attribute determines only how the scan
lines are arranged in the file.

## Tiles

When application code writes or reads a tiled image, the tiles can be
accessed in any order. When a tiled file is written, application code
must set the lineOrder attribute. The openexr crate may buffer and sort
the tiles, depending on the setting of the lineOrder attribute and the
order in which the tiles arrive. On reading a tiled image, application
code can avoid "seek" operations and read the file as fast as possible
by reading the tiles sequentially, in the order as they appear in the
file.

For tiled files, line order is interpreted as follows:

<table style="width:99%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 21%" />
<col style="width: 78%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header header">
<th>Line order</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>

If an application program produces tiles in an essentially random order,
then selecting [`LineOrder::IncreasingY`] or [`LineOrder::DecreasingY`] line order may force OpenEXR to allocate significant amounts of memory to buffer tiles
until they can be stored in the file in the proper order. If memory is
scarce, allocating the extra memory can be avoided by setting the
file\'s line order to [`LineOrder::RandomY`]. In this case the library doesn\'t buffer
and sort tiles; each tile is immediately stored in the file.

# Data Compression

OpenEXR offers several different data compression methods, with various
speed versus compression ratio tradeoffs. Optionally, the pixels can be
stored in uncompressed form. With fast file systems, uncompressed files
can be written and read significantly faster than compressed files.

Compressing an image with a lossless method preserves the image exactly;
the pixel data are not altered. Compressing an image with a lossy method
preserves the image only approximately; the compressed image looks like
the original, but the data in the pixels may have changed slightly.

In a multi-part file the compression method can be selected separately
for each part.

The following compression schemes are supported:

<p>PIZ compression works well for scan-line based files, and also for tiled files with large tiles, but small tiles do not shrink much.

</tr>
<tr class="even even">

# Luminance/Chroma Images

Encoding flat images with one luminance and two chroma channels, rather
than as RGB data, allows a simple but effective form of lossy data
compression that is independent of the compression methods listed above.
The chroma channels can be stored at lower resolution than the luminance
channel. This leads to significantly smaller files, with only a small
reduction in image quality. The specialized RGBA interface in the IlmImf
library directly supports reading and writing luminance/chroma images.
When an application program writes an image, it can choose either RGB or
luminance/chroma format. When an image with luminance/chroma data is
read, the library automatically converts the pixels back to RGB.

Given linear RGB data, luminance, Y, is computed as a weighted sum of R,
G, and B:

$$Y = R \cdot w_R + G \cdot w_G + B \cdot w_B$$

where the values of the weighting factors, $w_R$, $w_G$, and $w_B$,
are derived from the chromaticities of the image\'s primaries and white
point. (See [RGB Color](#rgb-color)).

Chroma information is stored in two channels, RY and BY, which are
computed like this:

$$RY = \frac{R-Y}{Y}$$
$$BY = \frac{B-Y}{Y}$$

The RY and BY channels can be low-pass filtered and sub-sampled without
degrading the original image very much. The RGBA interface in IlmImf
uses vertical and horizontal sampling rates of 2. Even though the
resulting luminance/chroma images contain only half as much data, they
usually do not look noticeably different from the original RGB images.

Converting RGB data to luminance/chroma format also allows
space-efficient storage of gray-scale images. Only the Y channel needs
to be stored in the file. The RY and BY channels can be discarded. If
the original is already a gray-scale image, that is, every pixel\'s red,
green, and blue are equal, then storing only Y preserves the image
exactly; the Y channel is not sub-sampled, and the RY and BY channels
contain only zeroes.

# Recommendations

## Scene-Referred Images

By convention, OpenEXR stores scene-referred linear values in the RGB
floating-point numbers. By this we mean that red, green and blue values
in the pixels are linear relative to the amount of light in the depicted
scene. This implies that displaying an image requires some processing to
account for the non-linear response of a typical display device. In its
simplest form, this is a power function to perform gamma correction, but
processing may be more complex. For example, one may want to apply a
"film look" or reduce the dynamic range of the original image before
displaying it. By storing linear data in the file (double the number,
double the light in the scene), we have the best starting point for
these downstream algorithms.

With this linear relationship established, the question remains, what
number is white? The convention employed by OpenEXR is to determine a
middle gray object, and assign it the photographic 18% gray value, or
0.18 in the floating point scheme. Other pixel values can be easily
determined from there (a stop brighter is 0.36, another stop is 0.72).
The value 1.0 has no special significance (it is not a clamping limit,
as in other formats); it roughly represents light coming from a 100%
reflector (slightly brighter than white paper). However, there are many
brighter pixel values available to represent objects such as fire and
highlights.

The range of normalized 16-bit floating-point numbers can represent
thirty stops of information with 1024 steps per stop. We have eighteen
and a half stops above middle gray, and eleven and a half below.
Denormalized numbers provide an additional ten stops at the low end,
with gradually decreasing precision.

## RGB Color

Simply calling the R channel red is not sufficient information to
determine accurately the color that is represented by a given pixel
value. OpenEXR defines a "chromaticities" attribute, which
specifies the CIE x,y coordinates for red, green and blue primaries, and
white; that is, for the RGB triples (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), and
(1, 1, 1). The x,y coordinates of all possible RGB triples can be
derived from the chromaticities attribute. If the primaries and white
point for a given display are known, a file-to-display color transform
can correctly be done. OpenEXR does not perform this
transformation; it is left to the display software. The chromaticities
attribute is optional, and many programs that write OpenEXR files omit it. If
a file doesn\'t have a chromaticities attribute, display software should
assume that the file\'s primaries and the white point match Rec. ITU-R
BT.709-3:

| | CIE x, y |
|---|---|
| red   | 0.6400, 0.3300 |
| green | 0.3000, 0.6000 |
| blue  | 0.1500, 0.0600 |
| white | 0.3127, 0.3290 |

## CIE XYZ Color

In an OpenEXR file whose pixels represent CIE XYZ tristimulus values,
the pixels\' X, Y and Z components should be stored in the file\'s R, G
and B channels. The file header should contain a chromaticities
attribute with the following values:

| | CIE x, y |
|---|---|
| red   | 1, 0 |
| green | 0, 1 |
| blue  | 0, 0 |
| white | 1/3, 1/3 |


## Channel Names

An OpenEXR image can have any number of channels with arbitrary names.
The specialized RGBA image interface in the OpenEXR library assumes that
channels with the names "R", "G", "B" and "A" mean red, green, blue and
alpha. No predefined meaning has been assigned to any other channels.
However, for a few channel names we recommend the interpretations given
in the two tables below. We expect this table to grow over time as users
employ OpenEXR for data such as shadow maps, motion-vector fields or
images with more than three color channels.

For flat images:

| Name         | Interpretation |
| ------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Y           |Luminance, used either alone, for gray-scale images, or in combination with RY and BY for color images. |
| RY, BY      |Chroma for luminance/chroma images, see above. |
| AR, AG, AB  |Red, green and blue alpha/opacity, for colored mattes (required to composite images of objects like colored glass correctly). |

For deep images:

| Name        |Interpretation |
|-------------|---------------|
| Z           |Distance of the front of a sample from the viewer. |
| ZBack       |Distance of the back of a sample from the viewer. |
| A           |Alpha/opacity of a sample. |
| R, G, B     |Red, green and blue values of a sample. |
| AR, AG, AB  |Red, green and blue alpha/opacity of a sample. Required for representing images of objects like colored glass, as well as for computing colored shadows. |
| id          |A numerical identifier for the object represented by a sample. Samples that belong to the same object have the same numerical identifier. |

For more information on the channels in deep images, see 
[Interpreting Deep Pixels](crate::doc::interpreting_deep_pixels).

## Layers

In an image file with many channels it is sometimes useful to group the
channels into layers, that is, into sets of channels that logically
belong together. Grouping is done using a naming convention: channel *C*
in layer *L* is called *L.C*.

For example, an image may contain separate R, G and B channels for light
that originated at each of several different virtual light sources. The
channels in such an image might be called "light1.R", "light1.G",
"light1.B", "light2.R", "light2.G", "light2.B", etc.

Layers can be nested. A name of the form
$L_1.L_2.L_3\... L_n.C$

means that layer
$L_1$ contains a nested layer $L_2$, which in turn contains another nested
layer $L_3$, and so on to layer $L_n$, which contains channel $C$.

For example, "light1.specular.R" identifies the "R" channel in the
"specular" sub-layer of layer "light1".

Note that this naming convention does not describe a back-to-front
stacking order or any compositing operations for combining the layers
into a final image.

## Color, Alpha and Compositing of Flat Images

The "over" operation for flat images creates a new composite image by
stacking a foreground image and a background image so that the
foreground image appears to be in front of the background image.

The A, AR, AG, and AB channels in a flat image represent a pixel's alpha
or opacity: 0.0 means the pixel is transparent; 1.0 means the pixel is
opaque.

By convention, the color channels of a pixel directly represent the
amount of light that reaches the viewer from that pixel (as opposed to
an amount of light that must first be multiplied by alpha). With this
representation, computing

$$composite = foreround + (1 - alpha) \cdot background$$

performs a correct "over" operation.

This color representation is usually referred to as "premultiplied
color." Some other image file formats employ a representation called
"straight" or "un-premultiplied color," where an "over"\
operation requires computing

$$composite = alpha \cdot foreround + (1 - alpha) \cdot background$$

Calling the color channels "premultiplied" does not mean that the color
values in an image have actually been multiplied by alpha at some point
during the creation of the image, or that pixels with zero alpha and
non-zero color channels are illegal. Non-zero color with zero alpha is
legal; such a pixel represents an object that emits light even though it
is completely transparent, for example, a candle flame or a lens flare.

In the visual effects industry premultiplied color channels are the
norm, and application software packages typically use internal image
representations that are also premultiplied.

However, some application programs have an internal image representation
with straight color. Since pixels with zero alpha and non-zero color can
and do occur in OpenEXR images, application programs with straight color
channels should take care to avoid discarding the color information in
pixels with zero alpha. After reading an OpenEXR image such an
application must convert the pixels to straight color by dividing the
color channels by alpha. This division fails when alpha is zero. The
application software could set all color channels to zero wherever the
alpha channel is zero, but this might alter the image in an irreversible
way. For example, a fully transparent flame on top of a candle would
simply disappear and could not be recovered.

If the application's internal straight image representation uses 32-bit
floating-point numbers then one way around this problem might be to set
alpha to $max(h, alpha)$ before dividing, where $h$ is a very small but positive value ($h$ should be a
power of two and less than half of the smallest positive 16-bit
floating-point value). This way the result of the division becomes
well-defined, and the division can be undone later, when the image is
saved in a new OpenEXR file. Depending on the application software there
may be other ways to preserve color information in pixels with zero
alpha.
